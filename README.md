## Cloud Sync & Recovery Explained ‚òÅÔ∏è

Your data is valuable, and our Cloud Sync feature ensures it's always safe.

### How Syncing Works
The Cloud Sync feature is **enabled by default**. This means every time you add, edit, or delete a claim, or change your settings, your data is automatically and securely backed up to our server.

You can check your sync status at any time using the icon in the header:
* ‚úÖ **Green Check:** Your data is successfully synced and up to date.
* üîÑ **Spinning Yellow Icon:** Data is currently being synced.
* ‚ùå **Grey 'X':** Syncing is disabled.
* ‚ùó **Red Alert:** There was an error syncing your data.

You can click the sync icon to open a confirmation box to disable or re-enable syncing. You can also click the "Force Sync" button (üîÑ) to manually trigger a backup at any time.

### How to Recover Your Data
If you get a new phone or need to reinstall the app, your data is not lost!

1.  **Find Your Recovery Code:** Click the **Recovery** button in the footer or the **SOS/Liferaft icon** (üÜò) in the header. This will open the Recovery Modal. Your unique, memorable recovery code (e.g., `Apple-Banana-Carrot-1234`) is displayed at the top. **Keep this code somewhere safe!**
2.  **Restore on a New Device:** On the new device, open the Recovery Modal and enter your recovery code into the "Restore from Code" field.
3.  **Click Restore:** The app will fetch your data from the server and restore it to your device, overwriting any local data.

## Data Security & Privacy

Your privacy and data security are our top priorities.

* **Local-First:** All your data is stored primarily on your device's local browser storage.
* **Anonymous Backup:** When Cloud Sync is enabled, your data is backed up to a secure Firebase server. This backup is tied only to your anonymous, randomly-generated recovery code. We do not store any personal identifying information.
* **Your Control:** You are in full control of your data. You can disable cloud syncing at any time. You can also permanently delete your entire server backup by using the "Delete Server Backup" button in the Recovery Modal.
